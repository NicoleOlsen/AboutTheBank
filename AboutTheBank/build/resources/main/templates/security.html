			<h3>Bond</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">Form of borrowing, where lender receives periodic interests and the amount borrowed.</li>
 				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
 				CHARACTERISTICS <br>
				fixed-income securities - lender can anticipate the exact amount of cash received<br>
				low risk - in case of bankruptcy, bondholders must be repaid from a liquidation in full before any shareholders are paid anything<br>
				<br>				
				EXAMPLE<br>
				goverment needs money for roads and the amount needed is higher than a bank can provide<br>
				<br>		
				ATTRIBUTES<br>
				buyer = lender<br>
				face value = amout borrowed<br>
				maturity date = date on which the issuer must repay the amount borrowed<br>
				interest - with rate and schedule (interest if often referred to as bondâ€™s yield or coupon)<br>
					- fixed interest<br>
					- variable rate (calculated on predetermined spread above some benchmark)<br>
				<br>
				Example:<br>
				corporate bond with a face value of $1,000, a coupon of 5% paid annually, and a maturity of 10 years<br>
				of $50 ($1,000 x 0.05) of interest per year for the next 10 years (because most corporate bonds pay <br>
				interest semi-annually by convention. You'd then receive two payments of $25 a year for 10 years.<br>
				When the bond matures in a decade, you'd then get your $1,000 back.<br>

			<h3>Share</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">Units of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset that 
				provide for an equal distribution in any profits, if any are declared, in the form of dividends.</li>
 				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
 				TYPES <br>
 				1. common shares: dividends not guaranteed (more risky), shareholders have voting rights<br>
 				2. preferred shares: dividend is paid out regularly (less risky)
 				Preferred stock takes priority over common stock, if the business files for bankruptcy.<br>
				Earnings per share (EPS) is the portion of a company's net income that would be earned per share 
				if all the profits were paid out to its shareholders.<br>
