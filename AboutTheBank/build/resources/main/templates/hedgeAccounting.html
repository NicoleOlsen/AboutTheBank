			<h3>Hedge relatonship</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
 				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
 				- can be effective or ineffective <br>
				- consists of two sides: hedged and hedging<br>
 				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
			<h3>Hedging</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
				- an strategy of minimizing potential investment losses<br>
				- this is done by taking an offsetting position in a related derivative whose value changes inversely<br>
				- the goal isn't increasing earnings but to protecting from different risks<br>
 				</li>
			</ul>
			</div> 
			<div class="container">
			<h3>Hedge effectiveness</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
				- an extent to which a hedge relationship results in intended offsetting changes (fair value or cash flows)<br>
				- effectiveness testing parameters: prospective, retrospective<br>
 				</li>
			</ul>
			</div> 
			<div class="container">
			<h3>Prospective</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
				- value changes of the hedged item are expected to be offset almost 100% by the changes of the hedging instrument<br>
 				</li>
			</ul>
			</div> 
			<div class="container">
			<h3>Retrospective</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
				- value changes of the hedged item must have been offset by 80%-125% by the change in the value of the hedging instrument<br>
 				</li>
			</ul>
			</div> 
			<div class="container">
			<h3>Hedges Supported</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item disabled">
				Foreign Exchange (FX) Cash Flow Hedge<br>
				- used to hedge an anticipated future payment or receipt of a fixed amount of foreign currency<br>
				- a cross currency swap is used to hedge a foreign currency debt or asset<br>
				- testing for the hedge is based on the HDM*<br>
				
				Interest Rate (IR) Cash Flow Hedge<br>
				- allows hedging of interest rate risk of a floating rate debt or investment using a variable-to-fixed rate swap or interest rate options such as caps and floors<br>
				- testing for the hedge can be based on fair value*<br>
				
				Interest Rate Fair Value Hedge<br>
				- used to hedge changes of fair value of a bond that is attributable to changes in a benchmark interest rate, such as LIBOR, i.e. an interest rate fair value hedge where fixed rate debt is swapped for floating rate debt<br>
				- effectiveness is evaluated by comparing the change in value of the bond to the change in value of the swap<br>
				
				Commodity Hedge<br>
				- allows hedging of a commodity contract using a commodity forward<br>
				- testing for the hedge can be based on fair value*<br>
				
				*HDM = Hypothetical Derivative Method = testing for the hedge based on fair value<br>
